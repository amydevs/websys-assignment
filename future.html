            Future

        <p>
            What I really want to do is to just retire and work on whatever and/or FOSS projects I want to.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just want to work on whatever I want to work on without the pressure of having to make money.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the short term, my todo list looks like:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Making a compiler
            </li>
            <li>
                Implementing a Game Boy emulator
            </li>
            <li>
                Working on a video game
            </li>
            <li>
                Becoming one of the main contributors of any successful FOSS project
            </li>
        </ul>
