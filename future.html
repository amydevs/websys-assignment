            Future

        <p>
           What I really want to do is to just retire and work on whatever and/or FOSS projects I want to.
        </p>
        <p>
            I just want to work on whatever I want to work on without the pressure of having to make money.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the short term, my todo list looks like:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Making a compiler
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implementing a Game Boy emulator
                </li>
                <li>
                    Working on a video game
                </li>
                <li>
                    Becoming one of the main contributors of any successful FOSS project
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
