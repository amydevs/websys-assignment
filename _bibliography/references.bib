  abstract="Apart from skipping headings, ropes, and the fact that you can't skip a stone 89 times, one of the most important elements that a designer can have an input on is contrast. Whether it is contrast between colors, contrast between sections within a website, or even contrast between shapes, it is an easy way to identify different elements on a canvas, and it is vital for accessibility and good usability. At least, in theory. And if you're noticing a pattern in me arguing about things that have long been accepted as the norm and have been proven to be correct, you're probably right. Call me argumentative all day long. You would be 100{\%} correct, so there's some data right there. Just because something has been accepted doesn't mean we should not change our minds based on available information, as keeping an open mind to change is exactly what we're talking about. Bottom line is that contrast matters. And it matters a lot.",
