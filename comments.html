            My site is designed as a personal introduction
        </p>
        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
        <p>
            The colour scheme that I've implemented is inspired from one of the first projects I've ever worked on, being the <a href="https://spinsha.re">Spinsha.re</a> desktop client. 
        </p>
        <h4>Colour Scheme</h4>
        <p>
            Whilst they focus on a dark-theme, I have focused on a light-theme to improve accessibility. According to an unofficial A11Y guidebook {% cite Georgakas2023 %}, users with astigmatism or dyslexia may have trouble with reading white text on black or dark backgrounds, which is a primary characteristic of dark-theme websites. As such, I've also decided to adapt the accent colours to better contrast on a white background.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking of my choice of colours, I have chosen a light berry-pink as my primary colour (#d61b69). This is elements such as the navigation bar indicator, as well as unclinked hyperlinks.
        </p>
        <p>
            My accent colour (#c52b6b) is a slightly darkened version of the primary colour. This is mainly used in visited hyperlinks.
        </p>
        <p>
            My secondary colour (#ffa3c9) is a lightened version of primary colour. This mainly used for backgrounds of cards and modal elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Taking inspiration from a web designed color theory guide {% cite ogrady_2023_color %}, my reasoning for deriving a colour palette from tints and shades of a base colour, is to build a monochrome colour palette. This offers a cohesive and unopionated colour scheme that is very readable and easy to maintain.

        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <p>
            The structure of my site is designed around most section elements spanning the entire height of the screen. This simulates the effect of a page break in a word document.
        </p>
        <h4>Spacing</h4>
        <p>
            To enforce a section height based on the viewport, I apply some CSS attributes to the section element. The 2 important attributes are the padding-top and the min-height. The padding-top is set to the navbar height, so that content will not be hidden behind the navbar. The min-width is calculated by the viewport height minus the navbar height.
        </p>
        <h4>Bento Box</h4>
        <p>
            The bento box design for my <a href="past.html#portfolio">portfolio</a> uses absolute positioning within a relatively positioned div. I did this rather than using a grid or a flex CSS display attribute, as it gives me greater flexibility in changing the size and shape of each item within the bento box without effecting the other elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bento box design was originally going to use the :focus-within pseudo-selector to be more intuitive, as rather than an item expanding to fit the bento box on hover, it would do it on click. However, I had to remove this functionality as the CSS parser used in Edstem did not support it.
        </p>
        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <h4>Accessibility Attributes on Elements</h4>
        <p>
            In order to be suitable for use with screen readers and other accessible technologies, I have included alt text on all images as well as titles on buttons. Furthermore, I have used custom tab-index attributes on the navbar elements so that navigation of the interface can be done entirely without a point device.
        </p>
        <h4>Spacing</h4>
        <p>
            According to a tutorial published by W3.org {% cite eggert_2015_styling %}, a line of text should not be more than 80 characters. Therefore, it is best to have adiquate whitespace from the edges of the page, so that the users attention does not need to divert back and forth across the entire screen. I achieve this by applying a maximum width to most of my section elements and my navbar. I also apply auto horizontal margins to center the section on the page, and a padding of 2.5rem that is only noticable once the viewport width is lesser than the original width of the content within it.
