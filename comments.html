        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>

            The colour scheme that I've implemented is inspired from one of the first projects I've ever worked on, being the <a href="https://spinsha.re">Spinsha.re</a> desktop client.

            Whilst they focus on a dark-theme, I have focused on a light-theme to improve accessibility. According to an unofficial A11Y guidebook {% cite Georgakas2023 %}, users with astigmatism or dyslexia may have trouble with reading white text on black or dark backgrounds, which is a primary characteristic of dark-theme websites. As such, I've also decided to adapt the accent colours to better contrast on a white background.

            Speaking of my choice of colours, I have chosen a light berry-pink as my primary colour (#d61b69). This is elements such as the navigation bar indicator, as well as unclinked hyperlinks.

            My accent colour (#c52b6b) is a slightly darkened version of the primary colour. This is mainly used in visited hyperlinks.

            My secondary colour (#ffa3c9) is a lightened version of primary colour. This mainly used for backgrounds of cards and modal elements.

            Taking inspiration from a web designed color theory guide {% cite ogrady_2023_color %}, my reasoning for deriving a colour palette from tints and shades of a base colour, is to build a monochrome colour palette. This offers a cohesive and unopionated colour scheme that is very readable and easy to maintain.
